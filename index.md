My Name is Gabe Schumm and I am Physics PhD student at Boston University. My area of research is Theoretical Condensed Matter, with a focus on Computational Many Body Physics.

Beyond Physics, I enjoy baking, sports analytics, and data visualization. You can check out my bakes, some of my sports content, and information about my reserach are linked above.
